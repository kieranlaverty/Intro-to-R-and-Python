The help function if you are unsure of what annoy other function will give the 
documentation and an explanation

```{r}
#example
help("library")

```


Using the library function you can load up package into your notebook
```{r}
library(tidyverse)



```



Importing "Shop Customer Data" dataset

The csv can be found at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientistanna/customers-dataset?resource=download


```{r}
shop_Customer <- read_csv("Customers.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

head(shop_Customer)

```


This is a method of making graph that gives a nice UI

```{r}
library(esquisse)
esquisser(shop_Customer)

```



A second method is to create the code using ggplot.

```{r}
ggplot(shop_Customer) +
  aes(x = `Annual Income ($)`, y = Profession) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "#112446") +
  theme_minimal()


```
